  workSummary: The code for this assignment was pretty straight-forward with most
    of it available on the textbook. The device setup and use were definitely the
    painpoints. Initially, the Oculus device did not detect on Unity. Then, I had
    issues in building the APK into Quest 2.  As I have never worked with a VR device
    before this, it was quite the learning curve for me, not just the setup but also
    operating the controllers. I also felt motion-sickness during some parts of the
    game.

  workSummary: My approach to this assignment was similar to my approach to the previous
    assignment - exploring and doing one function at a time. However, this time I
    was more familiar with Unity and Rider and it took me much lesser time to complete
    the assignment. One of the main challenges in this assignment was selecting the
    correct Bounds so that the mesh and the object move as expected in the correct
    directions. In my case I was initially not determining the bounds for z-axis
    correctly and that was making my game look different. The mistake I was making
    was that I did not assume Unity's left handed system. Once that was fixed, another
    issue was that all the meshes were clustered below shape 5. This was due to not
    creating correct transforms. This was relatively easier to fix. Overall I think
    the assignment provided a good learning experience.

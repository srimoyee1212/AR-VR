  workSummary: 'I think this assignment was a great way to get started with Unity.
    As a complete beginner to Unity, I faced challenges with the setup and connecting
    to Rider. I also faced challenges in viewing the unit tests on Rider. My approach
    to this assignment was one of an inquisitive learner. I looked into all of the
    assignment repository folders and files, then checked the assignment instructions
    on GitHub and then proceeded with the assignment. As I am also unfamiliar with
    C#, so I did a lot of Google search to find relevant in-built functions. I also
    read through certain parts of the assigned textbook to understand and implement
    the concepts. '

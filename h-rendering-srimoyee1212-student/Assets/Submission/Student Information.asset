  workSummary: My approach to this assignment was doing one function at a time and
    viewing the effects in Game mode. This was a slightly tricky assignment and I
    had to check the textbook for reference several times. One interesting thing
    is the lighting on the floor. It took a while for me to understand how the view
    direction and the ray direction affected the floor lighting. Another thing that
    took some pre-work to figure out was the role of the Raycast "hit" parameter
    in the mapped normal calculation to covert between local and world coordinates.
    Overall I think it was a very fun assignment to do though there is definitely
    a performance lag issue which is device based.

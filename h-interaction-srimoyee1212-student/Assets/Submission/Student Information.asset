  workSummary: 'After the locomotion assignment, I had a similar approach to this
    assignment. I start with a bottom-up approach and move forward with the functions.
    The only issue I found a bit vexing was passing the edge case test case in Far
    Interactor. Also for the grab interactor, the rotation and position orders had
    to be reversed to replicate the solution video but programmatically and test
    case-wise, I  did not get the difference. Other than that I found the assignment
    to be a good learning experience. '
